# eCommerce


This was a very fun project for me to work on that was very different from
the problem solving and logic software based applications I created. I wanted
to play around and learn how to use front-end languages, such as HTML and CSS,
so I emulated a mock template of an eCommerce website that sells athlethic gear.
